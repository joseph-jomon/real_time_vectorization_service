Certainly! Below is the updated Python code that includes the implementation of returning the vector as a JSON object, along with the necessary caching logic using a dictionary (as a simple in-memory cache example). In a production environment, you might use a more sophisticated caching system like Redis or Memcached.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, CLIPTextModelWithProjection
import torch
import numpy as np
import time
import hashlib

class TextVectorizer:
    def __init__(self, model_name="openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"):
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.text_model = CLIPTextModelWithProjection.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.cache = {}  # Simple in-memory cache

    def _generate_cache_key(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Generates a hash key for caching based on the input text."""
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

    def vectorize(self, text: str) -> dict:
        cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(text)
        
        # Check if the result is already cached
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            cached_data = self.cache[cache_key]
            return cached_data

        # If not cached, generate the embedding
        text_in = self.tokenizer(text=text, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
        with torch.no_grad():
            text_embedding = self.text_model(**text_in).text_embeds.squeeze().numpy()
        
        # Convert embedding to a list and prepare the response
        response = {
            "embedding": text_embedding.tolist(),
            "model": "openai/clip-vit-base-patch32",
            "timestamp": int(time.time())
        }

        # Store the response in cache
        self.cache[cache_key] = response

        return response
```

### Explanation of the Changes:

1. **In-Memory Cache (`self.cache`)**: 
   - A simple dictionary is used to store cached responses, where the keys are generated using a hash of the input text.

2. **Cache Key Generation (`_generate_cache_key`)**:
   - The `_generate_cache_key` method creates a unique cache key for each input text using the MD5 hashing algorithm. This ensures that different text inputs are cached separately.

3. **Caching Logic**:
   - Before generating the vector, the function checks if the result is already in the cache using the generated cache key.
   - If the result is found in the cache, it is returned immediately.
   - If not, the vector is computed, wrapped in a JSON object, and then stored in the cache before returning.

4. **JSON Object Response**:
   - The `vectorize` method returns a dictionary that includes the text embedding, the model name, and a timestamp of when the embedding was generated.

### Considerations for Production:

- **Cache Expiration**: 
   - This example doesn't include cache expiration logic. In a production environment, you might want to add a time-to-live (TTL) for cached items to ensure the cache stays fresh.

- **Persistent Caching**:
   - For scalability, consider using a persistent caching solution like Redis instead of an in-memory dictionary, especially if your application is distributed across multiple servers.

- **Error Handling**:
   - Depending on the use case, you may also want to add error handling, especially for potential issues during the model's execution.

This implementation allows the API to efficiently return cached text embeddings when available, reducing the need for redundant computations and improving the overall performance.
